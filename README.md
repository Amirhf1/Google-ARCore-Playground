```
ARCore provides SDKs for many of the most popular development environments.
These SDKs provide native APIs for all of the essential AR features like motion tracking, environmental understanding, and light estimation. With these capabilities you can build entirely new AR experiences or enhance existing apps with AR features.

# Running on your device

```
Google's ARCore developer preview for Android is awesome.
Unfortunately, Android phone like OnePlus is not on the supported list,
and apps built with ARCore exit at start on my device.

However, its hardware actually can run ARCore!

Using https://github.com/tomthecarrot/arcore-for-all, arCore can run on unsuported devices (only for test purposes)
